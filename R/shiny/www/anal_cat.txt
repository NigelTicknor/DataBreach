We found some interesting results when analyzing data pertaining to the type and category of breach. One surprising fact is that, of all the data leaked, banking data was actually the least stolen. In fact, educational data was stolen more than banking data over all! We think that banks focus too much on security to make hacking worth it. Other findings included that sensitive information relating to businesses and medical facilities was stolen the most, as those categories made up a majority of the information leaked. This is probably because medical data is very lucrative on the black market, and there are so many businesses, big and small, that are much easier to hack. Altogether, the data stolen in each category was made up of mostly digital information, rather than physical, sensitive documents; electronic data made up 85.71% of all data taken, while paper data filled up the latter. One interesting note is that hospitals have the most paper data stolen, even though they don't have the most breaches. This is probably because it is much easier to walk out with medical records or copies of them to steal them digitally.
