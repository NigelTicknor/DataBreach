The data parsing was done in a combination of <a href='https://nodejs.org/en/'>Node.js</a> and <a href='https://www.python.org/'>Python</a>. The Node.js scraper was written by Nigel Ticknor, and the Python one was written by Paul DeMange. We did this to minimize the time it took to scrape the data by optimizing our respective scrapers to our half of the data.
<br><br>The R code was written by Nigel Ticknor, Shaun Boerner, and Paul DeMange. Nigel wrote code to import and clean the data, Paul wrote some supporting functions, and all three of us wrote code to visualize the data. Nigel also wrote code to build and deploy a Shiny Dashboard.
<br><br>Nigel also wrote the additional JavaScript code that powers the DataBreach Dashboard alongside the Bootstrap framework.
<br><br>Nigel’s Github contains all R code and his parser, and can be found <a href='https://github.com/TicknorN/DataBreach'>here</a>.
<br><br>Paul’s Github contains his parser, and can be found <a href='https://github.com/pdemange/Data-Scraper'>here</a>.
