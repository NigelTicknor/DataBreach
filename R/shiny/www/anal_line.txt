From the line graph that depicts the number of breaches every year, it can be seen that there's a general increase in the number of breaches. However, the graph also depicts a dip around the 2009-2012 area in which data breaches were actually lower. This could have been due to a number of reasons, but the most prominent reasons were that the Cyber Security Act of 2009/2010 was passed, plus Obama issued an executive order around that time to harden critical infrastructure against any future offensive cyber-warfare. The Cyber Security Act of 2009/2010 mandated that government agencies/infrastructure do annual penetration tests, as well as give annual reports that assessed their current security. From both of these improvements,data theft could have been severely hindered, as data for government, medical facilities, and banks would have become much harder to steal information from. 

As for data breaches per month, it seems that data breaches tend to occur mostly during the beginning and end of the year, as well as more prominently during March, July, and little bit more during October. Other than that, there are really no clear patterns showing data breaches throughout the each year, as they seem to be a little bit more random than expected.
